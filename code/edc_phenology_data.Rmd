```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Read-in the data

```{r cars}

files <- list.files(path = "/Users/ruby/Projects/toolik_phenology/edc_data/2007-2017/data")

file <- files[1]

read_csv(file)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
