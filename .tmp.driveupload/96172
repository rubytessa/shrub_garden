This code file plots data on focal shrubs planted in the shrub garden.

\hypertarget{shrub-counts}{%
\subsection{Shrub Counts}\label{shrub-counts}}

This code summarizes the number of shrubs found across all the plots.
There is typically 1 alder, 2 birch, and 3 salix (transplant, trenched,
natural) per plot. Some plots have 2 alders. Some plots have 3 birch.
Some plots are missing a type of salix.

\hypertarget{struggle-shrubs}{%
\subsubsection{Struggle Shrubs}\label{struggle-shrubs}}

The following code plots the ``struggle shrubs'', noted in the inventory
as ``dead/questionable''. Note that for retagging the shrubs, we chose
the healthiest individuals, so these numbers will be an over-estimate of
survival percentage. Nevertheless, we did try to tag at least 1 alder, 2
birch, and 3 kinds of salix in each plot.

\hypertarget{shrub-inventory}{%
\subsubsection{Shrub Inventory}\label{shrub-inventory}}

We can than assess the number of shrubs doing relatively well in each of
the plots. The goal is to have at least 10 shrubs per treatment. For
now, things are going relatively OK!

TREATMENT DEATH: There are more sick shrubs in snow removal and nutrient
addition plots. There are fewer sick shrubs inside OTC's.

PLOT DISTRIBUTION: All plots have 1-3 alders. All plots have 2-3 birch
transplants. Salix are more spotty, with 11 plots are missing salix
transplants. 6 plots are missing trenched salix. 5 plots are missing
salix tagged as present. **note this will be updated when we check the
suspicious salix inconsistencies.

From this information, we can't clearly rule out using one or another
type of Salix origin. For this, we must assess size and vitality.

REPLANTING: I may need to replant 11 alder, 5 birch, and 9 salix. Only
one S.connected and one S.trenched are dead, but I should check on the
``retagging'' situtation as I think we retagged quite a few S.trenched
already so they are actually now S.connecteds.

\hypertarget{initial-shrub-sizes}{%
\subsection{Initial Shrub Sizes}\label{initial-shrub-sizes}}

We assessed the size of the shrubs to be able to standardize growth by
initial biomass of each shrub. This will also help us know if we need to
augment the experiment with any individuals by identifying short
weaklings.

On average, alders were 15 cm, birch were 10 cm, and salix were 13 cm.
There was substantial variation in the salix. I grouped alders by size
when planting, and tried to distribute evenly across treatments with
similarly sized individuals within a block. This is reflected in the
collected data.
